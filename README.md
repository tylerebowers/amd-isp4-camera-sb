# AMD ISP4 Camera Driver v8 (With Secure Boot Support)

Out-of-tree module for the AMD ISP4 camera found in Ryzen AI laptops (e.g., ASUS Zenbook S 16, HP ZBook Ultra G1a).

The driver is not yet merged into mainline Linux. This repo downloads the [patch series](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-media/20260212083426.216430-1-Bin.Du@amd.com/) via `b4` and builds it as a loadable module.

## Requirements

- Linux kernel 6.17.9+ (with `amd_isp4` platform driver, tested up to 6.18.12)
- Kernel headers
- Build tools and `b4`

```bash
# Arch
sudo pacman -S base-devel linux-headers b4
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r) b4
# Fedora
sudo dnf install kernel-devel kernel-headers gcc make b4
```

## Install & After Kernel Updates

```bash
make install
```

It is best to reboot after installing.  
This downloads the patches, compiles the module, installs it, loads it, and configures it to load at boot.  
Each kernel version gets its own build directory (`linux-<version>/`). Just run `make install` after updating your kernel.  

## Verify

```bash
lsmod | grep amd_capture
v4l2-ctl --list-devices
```
